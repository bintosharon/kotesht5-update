2. Configure Maven executable jar to find Mystery Number

Configure a maven executable jar which prompts user to enter a number and verifies if it is a Mystery number or not, and log the messages using log4j. 
1. In Mystery.java, 

a) code main() method to get input number from command line and check if it is a Mystery number . 
Log messages to mystery-finder.log in the below format 
2019-04-04 13:38:21 DEBUG Mystery::main()#21 - User input : 77 ... 
2019-04-04 13:38:21 INFO Mystery::main()#28 - Result: Whoa!!!! 77 is a perfect MYSTERY number ... 
2019-04-04 13:38:21 DEBUG Mystery::main()#21 - User input : 166 ... 
2019-04-04 13:38:21 INFO Mystery::main()#31 - Result: Ummm !!! No hidden MYSTERY in 166 

b) In areYouMystery() method, write code to find if input is a mystery number or not. 
(A mystery number is that number which can be expressed as sum of two numbers and those two numbers should be reverse of each other.) 

If it is a mystery number, log message in the below format. 
2019-04-04 13:38:21 DEBUG Mystery::areYouMystery()#42 - Found the Mystery: 77 = 16 + 61 

If it is not a mystery number, log message in the below format. 
2019-04-04 13:38:21 DEBUG Mystery::areYouMystery()#46 - Mystery not Found in 166 .
(This method should satisfy all the tests in MysteryTest.java) 

2. Configure log4j.properties to log messages to log file 'mystery-finder.log'. 
3. In pom.xml, package the project as an executable jar, with file name as "are-you-a-mystery.jar ". 
4. Configure appropriate maven plugin to download the dependency jars( junit, log4j,..) in the /target/classes/lib folder. Configure it to overwrite the existing jars only if a newer version is available. 
5. Execute the jar and verify the output as follows 
$mvn clean install 
$java -jar target/are-you-a-mystery.jar 
Wanna check if you have entered a Mystery number??? 
Enter your number here : 126 Ummm !!! No hidden MYSTERY in 126
