1. Task Dependency in Gradle
Getting started,
Select Run Tests to execute test cases and know your test results once you finish the challenge. 

Create a Gradle java application named gradleApp in the path /projects/challenge.
In gradleApp, create a custom task named copyReports which copies the build reports into a folder named Reports. 
Create another custom task named generateZip for packaging the reports into a zip file named reports, and store it in a folder named Archives. The generateZip task should be dependent on task copyReports.
Build the application and run the generateZip task.
