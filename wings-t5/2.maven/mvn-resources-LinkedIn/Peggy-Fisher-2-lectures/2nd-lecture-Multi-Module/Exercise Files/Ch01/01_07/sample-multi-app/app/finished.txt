My  son went to the  zoo . When she was there, she bought  hamburger ,  hotdog ,  39  chips and  lettuce . When she was  joggin out, she noticed that she knew the  cashier . It was our neighbor  Joe . They talked about his  fun  pencil and all the  tomatoes he would have in a few more weeks. When she got  amusementpark , she saw a  zebra in his  market . She chased it away to help save the  raspberries .
