My 1 went to the 2 .  When she was there, she bought 3 , 4 , 5  6  and 7 . 
When she was 8 out, she noticed that she knew the 9 . It was our neighbor 10 . 
They talked about his 11 12 and all the 13 he would have in a few more weeks. 
When she got 14 , she saw a 15 in his 16 .  
She chased it away to help save the 17 .
